# Introduction

## What Is The HTTP Status Library?

Ganbaro Digital's _HTTP Status Library_ is an easy-to-use way to add HTTP status codes to your value objects, entities, and exceptions.

* Ships with a prebuilt collection of HTTP status code value objects.
* Use traits to add instant HTTP status code values to your value objects, entities and exceptions.
* Implement the [`HttpStatusProvider`](reference/Interfaces/HttpStatusProvider.html) interface to show that your value objects and entities can provide a HTTP status code.
* Implement one of the [`HttpException`](reference/Interfaces/index.html) interfaces to show that your exception can provide a HTTP status code.

## Goals

This library is guided by these goals:

* Provide a library of known HTTP status codes
* Provide an easy way for value objects, entities and exceptions to map onto HTTP status codes
